Please consider my application for an Intern Developer position. As a third
year Computing major at Queen's University, specializing in Software
Development, I am a passionate, ever-learning, and detail-oriented
individual. Working as an intern, I would be an excellent addition to
your development Team. I have experience working in Agile development
processes like SCRUM, and I have thorough experience learning new
concepts on my own. Furthermore I have excellent time management and
communication skills from working in many facets of the arts and
sciences.

My professional experience has helped further my skills in project management,
development-best-practices, and independent learning as well as
critical thinking. Working at Metronome Growth Systems for the past two
summers as an intern Test Developer, I designed and implemented suites
of unit \& integration tests which standardized test formats and
significantly increased test coverage. This gave me a better
understanding of how to work with others using VCS (Version Control
Systems like Git) and how to effectively comment and read code which I,
myself, hadn't written. Additionally, I maintained daily \& weekly
communications will all levels of the company which helped me improve
my professional communication skills. By actively participating in all
Agile planning sessions I was able to expand my knowledge and
experience of development processes and improve my ability to convey
important information concisely and effectively.

As Head Speaker and Policy Officer of the Queen's Computing Students'
Association (COMPSA), I was given the role of refactoring the
constitution to reflect the current values of COMPSA as well as
organizing and chairing all Association assemblies. During my tenure
I worked with all levels of the Association to design and implement an
organizational system based on Management by Objectives in Notion to
facilitate stronger communication between portfolios. Working in this
position gave me a newfound respect for well structured teams and
allowed me to expand my knowledge of organizational behaviour, letting
me apply what I have learned through my studies to a real-world problem.
I would not have been able to balance my obligations to
school and the Association without improving my time management skills
-- which I have done successfully in this role. 

I have been vocalist in the Kingston Chamber Choir for the past three years,
which grounds me in the arts and allows me to explore different ways of
expressing one's ideas. Communication and a passion for learning have
been crucial for all my roles as I found that asking people for help is
just as important as being able to learn something yourself. Continuing
to improve these skills, and learn new ones is so important to me in
this fast changing world As a dynamic individual I believe I would be
a great addition to any development team that is looking to grow, and
push the envelope of what is possible.

Thank you for your time and consideration -- and I look forward to your
response.
