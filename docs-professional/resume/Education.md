### $\years{2020}$High School Diploma$\place{{Whistler Secondary School}}$

In grade 12 I took my first Computer Science class with [Mr.
Walzl](https://www.walzl1.com/). The experience of understanding the problems
given to me, and then coming up with a solution for them -- was eye opening for
me. It ignited a passion for problem solving and tinkering that I haven't been
able to shake.
