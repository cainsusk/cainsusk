This memo outlines the various changes this Ministry would like to take on
within The Association.
Primarily, these changes pertain to our internal image as an organization.
Within this topic, there are two main areas of concern: _Internal Communication
& Documentation_

As of late, our ability to communicate between portfolios has been a major
sticking point for our organization. This is because Discord is not designed or
meant to be a place for people to work -- but rather a place for socialization.
And while socialization among peers should certainly be encouraged, this cannot
come at the expense of The Association's ability to carry out it's mandate. 
To resolve this, I propose that E-mail become a more primary mode for
communication within the association, in order to better centralize important
mass-communications.

As programmers, it is well known to us that naming is one of the hardest and
most important tasks we undertake. This is because we are attempting to
communicate a broad idea or concept in very few words. With this in mind, the
Ministry believes that our current naming scheme within The Association does
not serve it justice both for the work it does and the importance it has in the
School of Computing. Furthermore our current naming scheme does not clearly
indicate where we are within the wider hierarchy of student organizations at
Queen's
Thus, this Ministry proposes that the names be changed to mirror those of the
Canadian government, where Directors are now Ministers, the President is now
the Premier, and the V-P's are now Officers. To go along with these changes,
this Ministry will create document templates (as well as other designs, like
email signatures), like this one, which will further denote the naming and
importance of The Association. Ad


Through these changes, this Ministry hopes that The Association can become more
reachable to students, through our emails, and also more respectable to those
who we want respect from, like potential sponsors.
