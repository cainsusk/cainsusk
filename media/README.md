# METAPOST


METAPOST is a macro language inspired by Donald Knuth's METAFONT which is
designed to programmatically create graphics which can be output in`.svg`,
`.ps`, and `.png` formats.

METAPOST is installed using the Tex-Live package:

        texlive-metapost

Additionally, METAPOST can be embedded directly into `.tex` files if `LuaLatex`
is used as the engine.
