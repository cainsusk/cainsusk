# Team Huddle Agenda -- _29.06.2023_

#### Introductions, with an ice-breaker !!!

* Say your full name (for fun!), as well as your year of study and program
  (with specialization etc.)
* The ice-breaker is: What is your favourite programming language, and why
  ! (pls not Java-script)

#### Go over positions for the year !!

* Mercy -- Chief Liaison for the Ministry of Internal Affairs 
\
  _Chief Internal Liaison_

* Hugh -- Chief of Communications for the Ministry of Internal Affairs
\
_Chief of Internal Communication_

#### Cover chief responsibilities for the summer

* Fall Volunteer hiring -- we gotta do it !
* Ensure all activities in the constitution are planned for -- theres alot we
  haven't done in the past few years... (but not for a lack of trying)
* Planning and calendars -- we gotta make sure the rest of these people know
  what they gotta do! (and why)
* Figure out the exact format of General Assemblies -- they need to be more
  dynamic! Mainly just a brainstorming thing though.

#### Go over memo for desired changes within The Association

* Alter the names of positions within the association to make them more
  meaningful, and and important sounding -- ie. "Minister" instead of
  "Director" etc. And along with this, make some fancy letterhead as well!
  (like this one). This is  aims to accomplish the goals of:

  * Make COMPSA's position within the wider student government more obvious by
    our naming scheme (ie. We'd have a premier, not a Prime Minister)

  * Make the positions in COMPSA more desireable and respectable (ie. How good
    does "Minister" or "Chief" look on linked-in -- _really good_)

* Make email an actually viable way to communicate to and from The Association.
  Right now our email is sidelined -- which really restricts our ability to
  communicate with people outside of Discord.
