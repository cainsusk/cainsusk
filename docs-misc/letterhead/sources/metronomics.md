# Determining Software Requirements

Firstly, __requirements__ can be defined as statements (one sentence) which
define a specific action or need. Multiple requirements then make up
a __feature specification__, which should provide the "why" and "how" for a feature.
There are two distinct _types_ of requirements. These are: _functional
requirements & business requirements_.

#### Business Requirements
Provide the "why" for a specification. They are
requirements that relate to a _business'_ objectives and goals. They provide
the scope in which a specification resides.

#### Functional Requirements
Are the "how" for a specification. They provide the
specific _functionality_ that should be added. They provide the list of tasks
to be finished to complete the specification.

## Requirements Document

In order to effectively catalogue these requirements to create a specification,
a _requirements document_ should be created for both types. These documents
should encompass all reasoning -- as well as all requirements -- for a feature
specification.

#### Business Requirements Documents (BRD)
Describe the high-level business needs for a feature specification. The target
audience of a BRD should be the user and it should be understandable to the
